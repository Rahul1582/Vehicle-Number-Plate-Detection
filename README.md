# Vehicle-Number-Plate-Detection

This helps us to detect the number on the number plate of a vehicle..


## Dataset Used 

I had used the Vehicle Number Plate Detection dataset from kaggle for the Deep Learning + OPENCV Approach 

Dataset can be found [here].

## Different Notebooks

Here are the different notebooks:

[Deep Learning + OPENCV Approach](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Rahul1582/Vehicle-Number-Plate-Detection/blob/master/Number%20Plate%20Detection%20Deep%20Learning.ipynb): Used CNN + OPENCV here for the Vehicle number Detection.

[OPENCV Approach](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Rahul1582/Vehicle-Number-Plate-Detection/blob/master/Vehicle%20Number%20Plate.ipynb): Used purely OPENCV here for the Vehicle number Detection.
 

## Technologies Used
```
1. CNN VGG16

2. OPENCV

3. Tensorflow

4. Keras

5. Pytesseract
```

## Results

These were the Car Numbers detected after both the approaches..
